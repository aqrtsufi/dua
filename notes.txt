i want to use vue3, vite, ts, pwa, daisyUI, tailwind to build an app for a dua book. tell me if you understand what dua is. tell me if using these tools are the latest available technology, or is there something better that i am missing. do not give me code yet. tell me concisely what i am asking and give me some specific suggestions. the app should be accessible friendly for blind person, 

I understand your request. Let me break it down and provide some insights:
Understanding of Dua:
Dua is an Arabic term meaning supplication or invocation. In Islamic practice, it refers to the act of making requests or prayers to Allah. A dua book typically contains a collection of these supplications for various occasions and purposes.
Technology Stack:
The technologies you've mentioned (Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript, PWA, DaisyUI, and Tailwind CSS) are indeed modern and widely used for web application development. This stack is suitable for creating a responsive and efficient dua book app. However, there are a few considerations:
Vue 3 and Vite are excellent choices for a fast and reactive frontend.
TypeScript adds type safety, which is beneficial for larger projects.
PWA capabilities will allow offline access and app-like experience on mobile devices.
Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI provide a robust styling framework.
Accessibility Considerations:
For making the app accessible to blind users, you'll need to pay special attention to:
Proper semantic HTML structure
ARIA attributes where necessary
Keyboard navigation
Screen reader compatibility
High contrast mode options
Suggestions:
Consider adding a state management solution like Pinia for Vue 3.
Implement text-to-speech functionality for reading duas aloud.
Include a search feature with voice input for easier navigation.
Use Vue I18n for internationalization to support multiple languages.
Implement a dark mode for better readability in low-light conditions.
Consider adding haptic feedback for touch interactions on mobile devices.
Additional Technologies to Consider:
Nuxt 3: A powerful Vue 3 framework that can enhance your development experience and provide additional features like server-side rendering.
Vitest: A Vite-native unit testing framework that integrates well with your stack.
Cypress: For end-to-end testing, especially important for ensuring accessibility features work correctly.
These technologies and suggestions should provide a solid foundation for building an accessible and feature-rich dua book app. Let me know if you need more specific information on any aspect of the project.

the app will not be for accessible needy people only, 
let's start build it. 
i want a home page. 
i want main pages that should take full view on phone:
Positivity Prayers
prayer contents will be on a text file on github. 

after "A:" will be each line of prayer, first line is title: Zikr
after "E:" will be meaning of each of these prayers, 
when displayed, 
what is a nice way to display both the prayer and their meaning right next to it or (right under it if small screen)

there are around 20 lines like this.

then another page there is Protection Prayers
these are the 3 quls. it can show the name of each, and when we tap on each it expands, and further if one taps on a translation button it displays translation. 
after 3 quls should be Salawat and Fatiha

and traveling prayers consists of 3 lines
another page for that, but protection prayers should also be mentioned here. 

and ya sin 12 first verses

@Dua October 7 2024.pdf does this file help? 
do not give me code yet, tell me if you understand everything i am saying up, and how you will proceed. give me concise response for each point i mentioned. 

I understand your requirements for the dua book app. Let me summarize and provide a concise response for each point:
Home Page:
Create a welcoming home page with easy navigation to other sections.
Main Pages (full view on phone):
a. Positivity Prayers:
Fetch prayer content from a GitHub text file.
Display format: Prayer (A:) and Meaning (E:) side by side on larger screens, stacked on smaller screens.
Implement a responsive layout to handle about 20 prayer lines.
b. Protection Prayers:
Display the names of the 3 Quls.
Implement expandable sections for each Qul.
Add a translation button to show/hide translations.
Include Salawat and Fatiha after the 3 Quls.
c. Traveling Prayers:
Display 3 lines of traveling prayers.
Include a reference or link to Protection Prayers on this page.
d. Ya Sin:
Display the first 12 verses of Surah Ya Sin.
Content Source:
The "Dua October 7 2024.pdf" file will be useful for extracting the required content.
Approach:
Create a responsive Vue 3 component for each main page.
Implement a layout system that adapts to different screen sizes.
Use Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling and UI components.
Fetch prayer content from GitHub using an API call or during build time.
Implement expandable sections and translation toggles using Vue's reactivity.
Ensure proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility.
Next Steps:
Set up the Vue 3 project with Vite and TypeScript.
Create the basic routing structure.
Develop reusable components for prayer display.
Implement the layout for each main page.
Add interactivity (expansion, translation toggle) where needed.
Ensure responsive design and accessibility features.

Notes:
BSH means Book starts here

POSITIVITY PRAYERS

The Positivity Prayers is a summary of what we 
need daily at all levels. We should read this for 
ourselves, our family and children, or anyone that 
we need to pray for.

Procedure of reciting the Positivity Prayers

We should make our connection to our heart. 
The biggest blessing from Allah is guidance. So, 
first of all we should pray for ourselves and our 
family, and even our enemies to have guidance to 
the truth with ease. So, by directing our intention 
to the person that we are praying for, we can do 
the following zikr:

Ya Hadi Ya Haqq Ya Latif

For more explanation, follow the link below.

when extracting from txt file, start considering content for book from BSH:
whatever is before are just notes that should be ignored and not be present anywhere in the book. 

see above what is in the txt file at start, and implement it onto the app, be creative. but do not modify my contents, if you do, tell me how you did. 

let's go!

I understand your requirements and the structure of the content file. Here's how I propose to implement this in the app:
Content Extraction:
We'll start extracting content from "BSH:" (Book Starts Here) in the text file.
Everything before "BSH:" will be ignored.
Positivity Prayers Page Structure:
Title: "POSITIVITY PRAYERS"
Introduction: The paragraph explaining what Positivity Prayers are.
Procedure: The section explaining how to recite the prayers.
Link: Include the bit.ly link as a clickable element.
Recommendation: The paragraph about repeating the prayers.
Prayers Display:
Create a list or grid of prayer items.
Each item will contain:
Arabic prayer (A:)
English meaning (E:)
On larger screens, display Arabic and meaning side by side.
On smaller screens, stack Arabic on top of the meaning.

Interactive Elements:
Make each prayer item expandable/collapsible for easier navigation.
Add a "Copy" button for each prayer to allow users to easily copy the text.
Additional Features:
Implement a search function to find specific prayers.
Add a counter feature for users to track their recitations.
Styling and UI:
Use Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to create a clean, modern interface.
Ensure proper contrast and readability for all text.
Implement a dark mode option for comfortable reading in low light.
Accessibility:
Use proper heading structure (h1, h2, etc.) for screen readers.
Implement ARIA labels for interactive elements.
Ensure keyboard navigation works smoothly.
I haven't modified your content, but I've proposed a structure to present it effectively in the app. The main creative elements are in the UI/UX design and interactive features to enhance usability.

This component creates a basic structure for the Positivity Prayers page. Here's what it does:
It displays the title, introduction, procedure, link, and recommendation.
It creates a list of prayers, each with its Arabic text and meaning.
On larger screens, the Arabic and meaning are side by side. On smaller screens, they stack.
It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
To use this component, you'll need to import it into your main App.vue or router configuration, depending on your app structure.
Next steps:
Implement the expandable/collapsible functionality for each prayer item.
Add a "Copy" button for each prayer.
Implement a search function.
Add a counter feature for tracking recitations.
Implement dark mode.
Enhance accessibility features.

Now you have a basic Vue 3 app with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI set up, and the PositivityPrayers component should be visible when you run the app.
Next steps would be to:
Implement the data fetching from a GitHub text file
Add more interactivity to the PositivityPrayers component
Implement routing for additional pages
Enhance the UI and accessibility features
Let me know which part you'd like to focus on next!
